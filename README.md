# Mob Waves

Set off waves of mobs against the player on a regular basis.

Based on the zombie-waves mod.

## TODO

What kind of Minetest game do I want to make?

Right now I basically want to re-create 7-Days to Die, in the following ways:
* Have a wave of zombies attack your area every 7 days.
* etc?  See below.



Extensible gridless craft system
===============================================
https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=17588

Goals:
* Craft items should be selectable from a series of tabs.
* Every item should have a "bake" time based on complexity.

Mobs Redo
===============================================
https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=9917

Goals:
* Create a sub-mod for zombies based on the Creatures MOB-Engine.

Creatures MOB-Engine
===============================================
https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=8638
I like the models in this mod better than Mobs Redo.

Proposed Mod - mobs-zombies
===============================================
* Grab model (and possibly behavior?) from Creatures MOB-Engine.
* Create a zombie spawn egg for testing.
* Zombies should spawn during day and night.  Need a regional density parameter.
* Zombies move much faster at night, and can break stuff.

Zombies Mod
===============================================
https://github.com/minetest-mods/zombies
Adds 3 different types of zombies.
Based on mobs-redo?

Can I use this to figure out how to track how many days have passed?
